# Anthropic MLE Interview Questions

## Problem 1: Constitutional AI Training Implementation

### Question
"How would you implement constitutional AI training for a language model?"

### Concept Overview
Constitutional AI (CAI) is Anthropic's approach to training AI systems that are helpful, harmless, and honest. The key concepts include:

- **Self-supervision**: The model learns to self-correct and improve
- **Constitutional principles**: Defining basic rules for AI behavior
- **Harmlessness vs helpfulness**: Balancing safety with utility
- **RLHF integration**: Combining human feedback with reinforcement learning


## Problem 2: Real-time Harmful Output Detection System

### Question
"Design a system to detect and mitigate harmful outputs in real-time."

## Problem 3: Advanced Constitutional AI Training Details

### Technical Implementation Components
#### Data Preparation with Constitutional Principles


## Summary

These three solutions demonstrate comprehensive approaches to key challenges in developing safe and aligned AI systems:

### Problem 1: Constitutional AI Training
- **Multi-phase training**: Supervised fine-tuning followed by constitutional training
- **Critique-revision cycles**: Self-improvement through iterative refinement
- **Principle encoding**: Embedding constitutional principles into the training process
- **Evaluation metrics**: Measuring harmlessness, helpfulness, and consistency

### Problem 2: Real-time Harm Detection
- **Multi-layer detection**: Fast keyword filtering, semantic analysis, and context understanding
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on feedback
- **Performance optimization**: Batching, caching, and quantization for low latency
- **Comprehensive harm types**: Violence, hate speech, misinformation, privacy violations

### Problem 3: Advanced Implementation Details
- **Self-critique architecture**: Model modifications to support internal critique generation
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balancing language modeling, constitutional adherence, and harm prevention
- **Scalability solutions**: Distributed training, memory optimization, and training stability
- **Engineering considerations**: Production-ready implementations with proper error handling

These implementations provide a solid foundation for building constitutional AI systems that are both effective and scalable for real-world deployment.
